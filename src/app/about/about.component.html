        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Matt Brooks, an aspiring software developer and QA/QE professional transitioning from a background in education. With a Bachelor's Degree in English, I’ve honed my problem-solving and communication skills, which I now apply to my work in technology. After completing a coding bootcamp and a QA/QE course, along with earning a Google IT certificate, I’ve gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development.

          Although I’m currently a Substitute Teacher, I’m eager to bring my passion for problem-solving and my growing technical skills into a meaningful career in the tech industry. I thrive on tackling challenges and view each bug in code as a puzzle waiting to be solved. My goal is to build a promising career in technology where I can continue learning and growing.

          Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, Dungeons & Dragons, board games, and diving into movies, television, and general nerd culture. One of my personal goals is to earn my private pilot's license—a way for me to symbolically conquer my fear of heights. I’m driven by the prospect of a rewarding and dynamic career, and I’m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
